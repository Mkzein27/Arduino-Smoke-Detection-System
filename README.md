# Arduino-Smoke-Detection-System
IoT Fire Safety: Intelligent Gas & Smoke Detection
----------------
This project goes over 2 objectives:
1) Creating an alarm that alerts in the case of a fire, smoke and gas leaks
2) Integrating the use of a Ubuntu-based server for data logging and displaying data on an iot dashboard.
-----------------
Key Features:
1) Uses rolling average to avoid false readings.
2) extremely simple to set up.
-----------------
Future developments:
1) Adding wifi connectivity
2) Allow data to be sent to a home server/ public server
3) Add other air quality sensors
4) Create a dashboard to display readings
-----------------
Hardware:
1) Microcontroller: Arduino
2) Sensors: MQ-2 gas & smoke sensor (Any other suitable sensor could also be used)
3) Actuators: Buzzer (MB12A12)
4) Breadboard
5) jumper wires
-----------------
Software:
